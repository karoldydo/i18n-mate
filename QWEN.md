# i18n-mate Project Context

## Project Overview

i18n-mate is a web application for centralized management of i18n (internationalization) translations for frontend projects. It provides a unified process for creating and maintaining translation keys, separation of translations from code, fast translation using LLMs, and export in a ready-to-use format compatible with i18next.

The project is currently in early development/MVP phase and targets frontend developers who need to manage i18n in their applications. It addresses common challenges like data fragmentation, lack of standardization, and code separation for translations.

```

### Setup and Installation

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Set up environment variables in a `.env` file:

   ```env
   # Supabase
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key

   # OpenRouter.ai
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key
   OPENROUTER_MODEL=model_name

   # Testing (optional)
   TEST_EMAIL=your_test_email
   TEST_PASSWORD=your_test_password
   ```

### Supabase Scripts

- `npm run supabase:start` - Starts local Supabase services
- `npm run supabase:stop` - Stops local Supabase services
- `npm run supabase:reset` - Resets local Supabase database
- `npm run supabase:migration` - Runs database migrations
- `npm run supabase:types` - Generates TypeScript types from local database schema
- `npm run supabase:functions:serve` - Serves Supabase edge functions locally

## Project Structure

The project follows a modern React + TypeScript + Vite setup with the following key directories:

- `src/` - Main source code
  - `app/main.tsx` - Application entry point
  - `shared/types/` - TypeScript type definitions
  - `test/setup.ts` - Test setup file

## Development Conventions

### Code Standards

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint with React 19 best practices, accessibility checks, and import organization
- Prettier with a 120 character print width, single quotes, and trailing commas
- Component file names use PascalCase with `.tsx` extension
- Utility files use camelCase with `.ts` extension
- Test files end with `.test.tsx` or `.test.ts`

### Testing Practices

- Testing Library for component testing
- Vitest for unit testing with JS DOM environment
- Goal of 90%+ code coverage (currently configured in vitest.config.ts)
- Setup file for test environment configuration

### Import/Export Style

- Path aliases configured (`@/*` maps to `./src/*`)
- ES modules for imports/exports
- Verbatim module syntax enabled in TypeScript

### Git Workflow

- Husky pre-commit hooks run lint-staged to ensure code quality before commits
- Linting and formatting enforced on staged files
- Commit messages follow conventional patterns (implied by repository structure)

## Key Features (MVP)

### Authentication & Authorization

- User registration with email verification (required before login)
- Login/logout functionality
- Password reset via email
- Session management (only after email verification)

### Project Management

- Create projects with name, description, immutable 2-4 character prefix, and immutable default language
- Edit project name and description
- Delete projects (with confirmation)
- Project list with pagination (50 items/page)

### Language Management

- Add languages to projects (BCP-47 compliant with normalization)
- Edit language labels
- Delete languages (cannot delete default language)
- Automatic normalization: language lowercase / REGION UPPERCASE
- Support for language/region pairs only (script/variant/extension sub-tags are rejected)

### Translation Keys & Values

- Add keys in default language only
- Key format: `[a-z0-9._-]`, no double dots (`..`), no trailing dot
- Unique full keys per project (prefix + "." + name)
- Delete keys in default language (cascades to all languages)
- Inline editing with autosave (< 1s average)
- 250 character limit per value, no newlines
- Empty values = missing (except in default language)
- Per-language view with filtering and search
- Missing filter and key search (case-insensitive contains)
- Pagination (50 keys/page) with stable sorting

### LLM Translation

- Translate all/selected/single keys using OpenRouter.ai
- Target language cannot be the project's default language
- Progress modal with status information
- Success/error toast notifications
- Automatic metadata tracking:
  - LLM: `isMachineTranslated=true`, `updatedBy=system`
  - Manual: `isMachineTranslated=false`, `updatedBy=<user>`
- Resilient handling of 429/5xx errors

### Export

- ZIP download containing `{lang}.json` files
- Dotted key format (i18next-compatible)
- Stable sorting, UTF-8 encoding, LF line endings
- Missing values represented as empty strings
- Removed languages excluded from export

## Out of Scope (MVP)

- Roles and permissions (single user can do everything)
- External API for accessing translations (UI-only ZIP export)
- Import of translation files
- Cost counting or token validation
- Organization entity
- Multi-user collaboration
- Key renaming
- Bulk import/export operations
- Translation memory
- Custom export formats

## Error Handling Architecture

The project uses a comprehensive error handling system documented in `ERRORS.md`. This document describes the structured error format used for database-raised errors, enabling reliable parsing and user-friendly error messages in the frontend. Key aspects include:

- **Structured Error Format**: All database errors follow a consistent pattern with exception message, PostgreSQL error code, structured DETAIL field, and helpful HINT
- **Error Code Catalog**: Comprehensive list of error codes organized by domain (authentication, project, locale, key, translation, job errors)
- **Frontend Integration**: Mapping between database error codes and frontend constants for consistent UX
- **Error Parsing**: Algorithm for parsing structured error details in the frontend
- **Migration Template**: Standard template for implementing new errors in database migrations

All database errors follow the format:

```sql
RAISE EXCEPTION 'Human-readable message'
USING ERRCODE = 'PostgreSQL_error_code',
      DETAIL = 'error_code:ERROR_NAME,field:field_name,additional:metadata',
      HINT = 'Helpful suggestion for the user';
```

## Project Status

The project is in early development/MVP phase, version 0.0.0, currently being built according to specifications in the Product Requirements Document.
