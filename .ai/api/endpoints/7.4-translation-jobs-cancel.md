# 7.4 Cancel Translation Job

**Endpoint:** `PATCH /rest/v1/translation_jobs?id=eq.{job_id}`  
**Description:** Cancel running translation job  
**Authentication:** Required

**Request Body:**

```json
{
  "status": "cancelled"
}
```

**Success Response (200 OK):**

```json
{
  "finished_at": "2025-01-15T10:18:00Z",
  "id": "uuid",
  "status": "cancelled"
}
```

**Error Responses:**

- `400 Bad Request` - Job not in cancellable state
- `404 Not Found` - Job not found or access denied

**Business Logic:**

- Can only cancel jobs with `status IN ('pending', 'running')`
- Edge Function checks cancellation flag between API calls
- Partially completed translations are kept
