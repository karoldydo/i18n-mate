# 3.2 Get Project Details

**Endpoint:** `GET /rest/v1/projects?id=eq.{project_id}&select=*`  
**Description:** Get single project by ID  
**Authentication:** Required

**Success Response (200 OK):**

```json
[
  {
    "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z",
    "default_locale": "en",
    "description": "Main application translations",
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "My App",
    "prefix": "app",
    "updated_at": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z"
  }
]
```

**Note:** `owner_user_id` is excluded from API responses since RLS policies ensure users can only access their own projects.

**Optimization Note:** For UI components that only need the project name (e.g., breadcrumbs), use the `useProjectName` hook which performs an optimized query fetching only the `name` field: `GET /rest/v1/projects?id=eq.{project_id}&select=name`. This reduces payload size and improves performance when full project data is not required.

**Error Responses:**

**401 Unauthorized:**

```json
{
  "data": null,
  "error": {
    "code": 401,
    "message": "Missing or invalid auth token"
  }

```

**404 Not Found:**

```json
{
  "data": null,
  "error": {
    "code": 404,
    "message": "Project not found or access denied"
  }
}
```
