# 5.4 Delete Key

**Endpoint:** `DELETE /rest/v1/keys?id=eq.{key_id}`
**Description:** Delete key and all translations (cascading). **Irreversible.**
**Authentication:** Required

**Success Response (Mutation Returns void)**

The mutation hook returns `void` (no content), equivalent to 204 No Content semantics.

**Implementation Details:**

The underlying Supabase/PostgREST API returns:

```json
{
  "count": 1,
  "error": null,
  "status": 200
}
```

The client hook interprets `count > 0` as successful deletion and returns `void`, normalizing the behavior to match REST conventions (204 No Content semantics).

**Error Responses:**

- `404 Not Found` - Key not found or access denied (`count === 0`)
  - Occurs when: Key doesn't exist OR RLS policy denies access

- `403 Forbidden` - Project not owned by user (RLS policy violation)
  - Occurs when: RLS policy check fails before query execution

**Business Logic:**

- Cascade deletes all translations for this key (ON DELETE CASCADE)
- Key name can be immediately reused after deletion
- Operation is atomic (transaction-safe)
