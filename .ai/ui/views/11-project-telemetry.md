# Project Telemetry

- **View Path**: `/projects/:id/telemetry`
- **Main Purpose**: Display project usage statistics for analytics
- **Key Information to Display**: Charts/metrics for events (project_created, language_added, key_created, translation_completed)
- **Key View Components**: Charts/metrics components, date filters
- **UX, Accessibility and Security Considerations**:
  - UX: KPI visualization (percentage of projects with multiple languages, average number of keys)
  - Accessibility: Alternative text for charts, keyboard navigation
  - Security: Only project owner can view telemetry
